## Introduction

Welcome to my GRIP repository, where I have documented my progress and achievements during the internship. This README provides an overview of the projects and tasks I've completed.

## Projects

Here's a brief description of the projects included in this repository:

### Project 01: Predicting Student Scores 

- **Description**: This project involves predicting student scores based on their study hours. It's a data analysis and machine learning project aimed at understanding the relationship between study time and academic performance.

### Project 02: Predicting Optimum Number of Clusters

- **Description**: This project involves the analysis of the Iris dataset to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering. The results are visually represented to showcase the data's natural groupings. The project demonstrates essential techniques in data exploration, clustering, and visualization, making it a valuable learning resource for data science enthusiasts.
