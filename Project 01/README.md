# Data Science & Business Analytics Internship - The Spark Foundation
**Batch: March 23**

:-: ##Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours

In this project, I embarked on a fascinating journey in the field of Data Science and Business Analytics as part of The Spark Foundation's March23 batch. My primary task was to predict the percentage of a student's score based on the number of study hours, employing various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Let's dive into the journey, breaking it down into key steps and showcasing essential metrics.

### Step 1: Importing Libraries
To get started, I imported essential Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries played a crucial role in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### Step 2: Loading and Understanding the Dataset
The dataset contains records of 25 students, each with two columns: 'Hours' and 'Scores.' I explored the dataset's properties, including data types and summary statistics.

### Step 3: Data Visualization
Visualizing the data through a scatter plot illuminated the relationship between study hours and scores. This step allowed us to grasp the correlation between these variables.

### Step 4: Data Preparation
In preparation for modeling, I divided the dataset into training and testing sets. This segregation ensured the accuracy of our predictive model.

### Step 5: Linear Regression Model
A Linear Regression model was employed to predict student scores based on study hours. I extracted essential model parameters, including coefficients and the intercept.

### Step 6: Result Visualization
To gauge the model's performance, I compared its predictions to the actual scores. Visualizations, including scatter plots and a regression line, provided a clear picture of the model's effectiveness.

### Step 7: Model Evaluation
I assessed the model using key performance metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 5.71
- Mean Square Error (MSE): 36.80
- R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination): 0.94

## Outcomes
Completing this project yielded several notable outcomes:

1. **Predictive Model:** Developed a robust predictive model for student scores based on study hours.
2. **Data Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning using Python.
3. **Model Assessment:** Evaluated the model's performance using MAE, MSE, and R2 Score, achieving an impressive R2 Score of 0.94.

This project serves as a significant milestone in my Data Science journey, equipping me with essential skills and knowledge for future endeavors.
