    <h2>Task 01: Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours</h2>
    <p>In this project, I embarked on a fascinating journey in the field of Data Science and Business Analytics as part of The Spark Foundation's March23 batch. My primary task was to predict the percentage of a student's score based on the number of study hours, employing various data analysis and machine learning techniques.</p>

    <h3>Let's dive into the journey, breaking it down into key steps and showcasing essential metrics.</h3>

    <h4>Step 1: Importing Libraries</h4>
    <p>To get started, I imported essential Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries played a crucial role in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.</p>

    <h4>Step 2: Loading and Understanding the Dataset</h4>
    <p>The dataset contains records of 25 students, each with two columns: 'Hours' and 'Scores.' I explored the dataset's properties, including data types and summary statistics.</p>

    <h4>Step 3: Data Visualization</h4>
    <p>Visualizing the data through a scatter plot illuminated the relationship between study hours and scores. This step allowed us to grasp the correlation between these variables.</p>

    <h4>Step 4: Data Preparation</h4>
    <p>In preparation for modeling, I divided the dataset into training and testing sets. This segregation ensured the accuracy of our predictive model.</p>

    <h4>Step 5: Linear Regression Model</h4>
    <p>A Linear Regression model was employed to predict student scores based on study hours. We extracted essential model parameters, including coefficients and the intercept.</p>

    <h4>Step 6: Result Visualization</h4>
    <p>To gauge the model's performance, I compared its predictions to the actual scores. Visualizations, including scatter plots and a regression line, provided a clear picture of the model's effectiveness.</p>

    <h4>Step 7: Model Evaluation</h4>
    <p>We assessed the model using key performance metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 5.71</li>
        <li>Mean Square Error (MSE): 36.80</li>
        <li>R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination): 0.94</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Completing this project yielded several notable outcomes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Predictive Model:</strong> Developed a robust predictive model for student scores based on study hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Proficiency:</strong> Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning using Python.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Assessment:</strong> Evaluated the model's performance using MAE, MSE, and R2 Score, achieving an impressive R2 Score of 0.94.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This project serves as a significant milestone in my Data Science journey, equipping me with essential skills and knowledge for future endeavors.</p>
